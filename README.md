# drunken diver

`drunken-diver` is a library for generating unique ASCII art for arbitrary byte sequences.

This library is inspired by the "drunken bishop" algorithm that is used to generate
SHA256 randomart. Unlike the "drunken bishop" algorithm, the "drunken diver"
algorithm aims to map each byte sequence to a unique piece of art.


# SECURITY ADVISORY

I have not completely vetted this library to ensure the implementation
correctly maps input to unique sequences. Use this library at your own risk.
